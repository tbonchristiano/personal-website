        <h2>About Me<span class="open-close"><button class="btn" id="btn1">open/close</button></span></h2>
        <p id="about-me-txt">I was born and raised in Brazil, find a piece of my identity in my Italian heritage, and realized my appreciation and passion for immersing myself in different cultures while living in Spain and the United States. My multinational background defines me. Creating long lasting and genuine relationships with people from all around the world fuels my interest and curiosity in learning from others and their diverse backgrounds and experiences.
            <br><br>Some of my interests include traveling, sports and languages.
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px;"><b>• Traveling:</b> every year, when choosing where to spend my vacations, a new and different location is always top of mind. So far, I have been to 19 countries and I'm eager to visit many more. Currently, my new top countries to visit are: Morroco, South Africa, Egypt, India and Japan.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Sports:</b> I follow an active lifestyle and enjoy working out, hiking, running, and learning new sports. I have been practicing water polo for over ten years and had the opportunity to play at both a national and professional level, representing my home country at the South American championship (more about it in the Sports section). Currently, I participate of a water polo masters team, a running club, and an adult volleyball sports league.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Languages:</b> my multinational background has taught me the appreciation of languages. Being able to communicate with someone with their first language is always more impactful. I'm fluent in Portuguese and English, and have a proficient level in Spanish. My two main goals at the moment are to improve my Spanish and to learn Italian.</span>
            <br>I'm a huge believer of (i) being drastically open minded, (ii) being able to figure things out in any possible way, (iii) being my best self at all times and in any situation.
            <br><br><i>ps: regarding my belief (ii) above, this website is a great example of figuring it out - I decided to learn how to code a website and, through free courses and Youtube videos, I learned how to write with html, css and javascript languages and built this website from the ground up.</i>

        <h2>Sports<span class="open-close"><button class="btn" id="btn3">open/close</button></span></h2>
        <p id="sports-txt">Since my childhood I have always had an active lifestyle. When I was a kid, I played several team sports such as basketball, handball, volleyball, and, as a true Brazilian, soccer. Right before becoming 12 years old, I learned about water polo and joined my sports club team. My last soccer position was as a goalie, so I also saw this new sport as an opportunity to play in the field and score some goals, but... You guessed it right, within my second practice I was already the new goalie in our water polo team. I ended up loving being a water polo goalie and never stopped playing the sport. Recently, I joined the Nashville Channels Cats masters team, where I practice once to twice a week and play tournaments throughout the year.
            <br><br>Some of the water polo teams I played for and awards I won:
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px;"><b>• UC Santa Barbara - Collegiate Division 1 (2017 - 2021):</b> awarded All-Academic Team (2018 and 2019), 1st Team All Gold Coast Conference and All-American Honorable Mention (2018), by keeping a GPA above 3.20 while practicing 15-20 hours weekly with weekend tournaments.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Menlo School - High School (2015 - 2017):</b> selected as a team captain during my senior year when I also broke the goalie record for the most saves in a season.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Brazilian National Team (2015):</b> selected as the starting goalie to represent our national team during the U17 South American tournament, which we won and had the best defense in the tournament.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Esporte Clube Pinheiros (2011 - 2015):</b> selected as the team captain on my age group; played from my age group all the way up to the adult/professional level; won several tournaments, both at national and state levels.</span>
            <br>Besides water polo, I also enjoy working out by myself at the gym and playing other sports with friends. I find that joining sport clubs is a very fun way to meet people. Currently, I participate of a run club that meets once a week to run 4 miles, of an adult coed volleyball sports league, and I play soccer with some local Brazilian friends.

        <h2>Education<span class="open-close"><button class="btn" id="btn4">open/close</button></span></h2>
        <p id="education-txt">I lived and studied in Brazil at Colégio Santa Cruz until I was 16 years old. However, in order to play sports at a top-notch level, Brazilian students have to play for a sport club since the academic instutions have zero sport focus. This creates a huge conflict for students athletes that have minimal to almost no support between their academic instituion and their sport club. Thus, in order to achieve my ambition to be a student athlete at both great schools and water polo teams, I decided to move to the United States. I ended up living with a host family in Northern California, where I finished my High School studies at Menlo School, and then going to the University of California Santa Barbara to pursue an Economics degree. During my Junior year in college, I also had the opportunity to study abroad during winter quarter at ESCI-Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Spain. Below are some additional highlights on my collegiate studies:
            <br><br><b>University of California, Santa Barbara (Goleta, CA) (Sep 2017 - Jun 2021)</b>
            <br>B.A. Economics (GPA: 3.61) and Technology Management Certificate (GPA: 4.0)
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px;"><b>• Relevant Courses:</b> Game Theory (A), Negotiations (A), Persuasion and Sales (A), Writing for Public Speaking (A-).</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px;"><b>• Technology Management Certificate:</b> consisted of 18 credit units designed to gain an understanding of entrepreneurial and business practices in emerging and global technology-driven companies. Coursework: Fundamentals of Business Finance, Fundamentals of Business Strategy, Principles of Marketing, Understanding and Managing Technology Organizations, Lecture/Speaker Series.</span>
            <br><span style="display: block; margin-left: 30px; margin-top: -17px; margin-bottom:-18px;"><b>• Honors:</b> Dean's Honors L&S (Spring 2020 - Spring 2021).</span>
